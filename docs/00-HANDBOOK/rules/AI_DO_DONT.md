# AI Do and Dont

<a id="ai-do-dont"></a>

## Do

- Follow the assigned tasks autonomously after they are defined.
- Add or update tests for each changed component.
- Run the relevant tests and report results only after they pass.
- Keep documentation links consistent with the handbook structure.
- Ask for approval before updating documentation or rules when the process changes.

## Dont

- Skip component-level tests for code changes.
- Report work as finished without passing tests.
- Change process docs without explicit approval after tested work.
- Create duplicate sources of truth.
- Introduce non-ASCII text unless the file already uses it.
