# Rules

Rules for IDE agents and contributors live in this folder.

Files:

- docs/00-HANDBOOK/rules/spediresicuro.mdc: Project context, stack, priorities, and constraints.
- docs/00-HANDBOOK/rules/spiega.mdc: Local guidance for behavior and responses.
- docs/00-HANDBOOK/rules/AI_DO_DONT.md: Operational do and dont list for AI.

If you add a new rule, keep it short, scoped, and link it from docs/00-HANDBOOK/README.md.
