{"plan":[{"step":1,"tool":"safe_write","goal":"Write changes to tests/fixtures/util_new.py using safe_write: implement slugify(text) that converts the input to lowercase, retains only alphanumeric characters, collapses spaces, underscores, and hyphens into a single hyphen, and trims hyphens from the ends. Add a self‑check block that prints the result of slugify(\"Hello, World!\") and whether it equals \"hello-world\"."}]}
